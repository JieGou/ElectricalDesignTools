Power Cables
	- 1ph cable quantities and totals
	- Prompt to recalculate load cables when changing settings
	- component cables are not updated when changing the load cable properties
	- cable derating not updated when loads are added to supplier

Finish excel export 
	- columns selection
	- cleanup notification


Systems & SubSystems
	- heatloss total by area
		- add cable to total with note
