Bugs
	- DELETE DTEQ does not retag Lcs cable
	- load cable length when updating components
	- SCCR calculation on DTEQ size change

Exports
	- Areas List
	- Area Equipment summary
	- Dteq loading summary
	- Components BOM
	- Cable list BOM


Refactorings
	- proper IPowerCableUser members
	- cable owners need to reference the cable
	- cable needs to reference source and destination
	- add reference to list manager inside each model object
	- SelectionLists or models

Validations
	- PD	
	- Cable
	
Modularize Calculations
	- Load

	- Dteq

	- Cable
		- Cable.LoadId
		- Source.Id, Source.Type
		- Destination.Id, Destination.Type

Optional Auto-Calculations
	- Component Sizing
	- PD
	- Cable

Cables
	- settings for auto-calculate cable on load resizing/recalculation
	- add cable tray
	- cable sizing based on next Upstream PD

	Power Cables
		- 1ph cable quantities and totals on cable list
		- Prompt to recalculate load cables when changing settings
		- component cables are not updated when changing the load cable properties

	Cable List
		- Tray
	

LoadGrid Context Menu
	- Set load factor

DistributionManager
	- FedFrom Voltage checks on FedFrom Changed

DaAccess
	- Create positive upsert/SaveList

Application Settings
	- auto-calc PD when load properties change
	- auto-calc cable when load properties change
	- default breaker rating (80% vs 100%)

Dteq 
	- SCCR vs SCCA
	- validate cable when AssignedLoads changes
	- dteq as LoadGraphicVew
	- Supply cable sizing based on upstream breaker (what is upstream breaker)
	
Load
	- Proper PD / Starter selection when calculating to take into account if a drive is selected
	- sequence number/ordering

Protective Devices
	- PD model
	- 80% vs 100% rated




Misc. General
	- 

Error Handling

Library
	- add cable dimensions
	- add connectors

Library Editor
	- Control Station Types
	- Cable Types

Tag Settings
	- basic tagging system
	- tagging logic
	- bulk updates on tag changes

Excel Reports
	- SWG / MCC loading and load list

Areas, Systems & SubSystems
	- heatloss total by area
		- add cable to total with note
	- proper heatload calculation for each equipment type

Component type selection
	- add typelist to components (will need separate classes for each component type)

Autocad
	- drawing list
	- drawing list manager
	- single line
	- schematics
	- wiring diagrams


ISSUES
	- Component Toggle is triggering the UpdatePowerCables for Components Cables method
	- Create Separate Components (dicsonnects, Drives, Etc)
