Power Cable
	- Cable lengths
	- Prompt to recalculate load cables
	- component cables are not updated when changing the load cable properties
	- cable derating not updated when loads are added to supplier
		- added default derating for DTEQ load cables


Finish excel export 
	- columns selection
	- cleanup notification


Add Systems & SubSystems
	- heatloss total by area
		- add cable to total
	- proper heatload calculation for each equipment type


Add component type selection
	- typelist to components (will need separate classes for each component type)





ISSUES
	- Component Toggle is triggering the UpdatePowerCables for Components Cables method
	- Create Separate Components (dicsonnects, Drives, Etc) 

	LoadGrid to CollectionListView (same as Dteq Grid)
		- changed with no speed improvement. Suspect it's a numbers thing
