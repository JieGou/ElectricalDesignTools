Bug Notes
	- combobox itemsSource values change because ComboBox.Text is bound. Need to bind to SelectedValue only.
	
Major Bugs
	- change MessageBoxes to ErrorDialog with error list


Minor Bugs
	- DCN and MCP frame size defaults to 1200 A
	- order of disconnect frame sizes
	- order of PD frame sizes
	- loads aren't changing voltage on FedFrom Update
	- SCCA/R calculation on DTEQ size change
	- transformer grounding
	- ProtectionDeviceModel.TypeList comboBox values disappear on PowerConsumer editor when Type is changed
	- LCS Analog cable Tag when VFD is in MCC

	- required amps tooltip does not update while CableSizingView_Narrow is in view
	- Cable SourceModel updates everywhere there is a Cable Source(tag) update bogs down the app

	- menu Views/ViewModels are slow to load on battery

		- add autotagging to DTEQ
		- finish cable settings page
		- finish load settings page
	- bulk updates on tag setting changes
	

Cables
	- Pivot Grid
	- Bom Style Export
	- 1ph cable quantities and totals on cable list
	- Prompt to recalculate load cables when changing settings
	- component cables are not updated when changing the load cable properties
		- setting for this?

***    AFTER RELEASE	***
***************************

Protective Devices
	- add 100% rated option

Applicaton Settings
	- default breaker rating (80% vs 100%)


- Move Component Up/Down into ComponentModelBase

Refactorings
	- Calculations 
	- proper IPowerCableUser members
	- add reference to list manager inside each model object

Data Access
	- Create positive upsert/SaveList
	
Cleanup Electrical Views
	- edt cable editor (property pane)
	- dual synchronize SigleLine ScrollViewers (to sync keyboard scroll)
	- add fed from button to graphic to select fedfrom equipment


Add selectable on click for Dteq
	- rename LoadGraphic Events back 

Modularize Calculations Better
	- Load

	- Dteq


Double/Decimal TextBoxes and values
	- standardize input/commit
