Refactorings
	- proper IPowerCableUser members
	- cable owners need to reference the cable
	- cable needs to reference source and destination
	- add reference to list manager inside each model object
	- SelectionLists or models

Bugs
	- DELETE DTEQ does not retag Lcs cable
	- load cable length when updating components
	- SCCR calculation on DTEQ size change

Validations
	- PD	
	- Cable
	
Modularize Calculations
	- Load

	- Dteq

	- Cable
		- Cable.LoadId
		- Source.Id, Source.Type
		- Destination.Id, Destination.Type

Optional Auto-Calculations
	- Component Sizing
	- PD
	- Cable

Cables
	- validate derating,  ampacity
	- settings for auto-calculate cable on load resizing/recalculation
	- add cable tray

	Power Cables
		- 1ph cable quantities and totals on cable list
		- Prompt to recalculate load cables when changing settings
		- component cables are not updated when changing the load cable properties

	Cable List
		- Tray

DistributionManager
	- FedFrom Voltage checks on FedFrom Changed

DaAccess
	- Create positive upsert/SaveList

Application Settings
	- auto-calc PD when load properties change
	- auto-calc cable when load properties change
	- default breaker rating (80% vs 100%)

Dteq 
	- SCCR vs SCCA
	- validate cable when AssignedLoads changes
	- dteq as LoadGraphicVew
	- Supply cable sizing based on upstream breaker (what is upstream breaker)
	
Load
	- LCS checkbox grey out like Drive checkbox
	- calculate single
	- Proper PD / Starter selection when calculating to take into account if a drive is selected
	- sequence number/ordering

Protective Devices
	- PD model
	- 80% vs 100% rated




Misc. General

Areas, Systems & SubSystems
	- heatloss total by area
		- add cable to total with note
	- proper heatload calculation for each equipment type

Component type selection
	- add typelist to components (will need separate classes for each component type)
