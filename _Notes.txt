Major Bugs
	

Minor Bugs
	- 1C cables
	- VFD trip/frame sizes
	- component AIC/SCCR calculation
	- added load needs to be shown / selected in views
	- MCP frame size list for PD Editor
	- Cable SourceModel updates everywhere there is a Cable Source(tag) update bogs down the app

*****************************************************************************************************************************

Misc.
	- LCS Analog cable Tag when VFD is in MCC
	- components and stand alone protection device list	
	- move calculate all into calculation manager
	- remove VSD


Transformer Grounding
	- NGR component
	- NGR Monitor
	- cables


Cables
	- Pivot Grid
	- Bom Style Export
	- 1ph cable quantities and totals on cable list
	- Prompt to recalculate load cables when changing settings
	- Copy cable properties to all branch circuit cables
	- calculation based on required cable conductors (2C, 3C, 4C)


Dteq 
	- dteq as LoadGraphicVew
	- Supply cable sizing based on upstream breaker (what is upstream breaker)


Library
	- add cable connectors
	- Starter sizes for other voltages
	- StarterSizes list for dropown


Library Editor
	- Motor Data editor
	- AIC
	- SCCR
	- Cables


Tag Settings
	- lcs cable TypeModel vs Type
	- add autotagging to DTEQ


Autocad
	- single line
		- main block
	- schematics
	- wiring diagrams
	- title blocks
	- drawing list


Areas, Systems & SubSystems
	- heatloss total by area
		- add cable length to total with note
	- proper heatload calculation for each equipment type


Exports
	- Areas List and equipment summary
	- Area Equipment summary
	- Dteq loading summary (panel loading for Dpanels)
	- Cable BOM
	- Component BOM
	- include / exclude all and multi-select
	- add Export buttons to Views


User Interface
	- Main Window Toolbar Height
	- DTEQ right click menu


***************************
***    AFTER RELEASE	***
***************************

- Panel Type Selector for 3-phase, 2-phase, 1-phase

- Move Component Up/Down into ComponentModelBase

Refactorings
	- Calculations 
	- proper IPowerCableUser members
	- add reference to list manager inside each model object

Data Access
	- Create positive upsert/SaveList
	
Cleanup Electrical Views
	- edt cable editor (property pane)
	- dual synchronize SigleLine ScrollViewers (to sync keyboard scroll)
	- add fed from button to graphic to select fedfrom equipment


Add selectable on click for Dteq
	- rename LoadGraphic Events back 

Modularize Calculations Better
	- Load

	- Dteq

Tag Settings
	- bulk updates on tag setting changes

Double/Decimal TextBoxes and values
	- standardize input/commit
