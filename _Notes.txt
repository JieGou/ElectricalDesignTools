	- Cable
	
Cables
	- settings for auto-calculate cable on load changes, resizing/recalculation
	- cable sizing based on next Upstream PD

	Power Cables
		- 1ph cable quantities and totals on cable list
		- Prompt to recalculate load cables when changing settings
		- component cables are not updated when changing the load cable properties
	
LoadGrid Context Menu

Data Access
	- Create positive upsert/SaveList

Application Settings
	- auto-calc PD when load properties change
	- auto-calc cable when load properties change
	- default breaker rating (80% vs 100%)

Dteq 
	- SCCR vs SCCA
	- validate cable when AssignedLoads changes
	- dteq as LoadGraphicVew
	- Supply cable sizing based on upstream breaker (what is upstream breaker)
	
Load
