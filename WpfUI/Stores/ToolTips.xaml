    <clr:String x:Key="AreaChangeInfoMessage" xml:space="preserve">Changing the Area of this equipment will update all the properties related to an 
Area (NEMA rating, Area Classification, Min / Max Temperatures, etc.) 
        
The area of related equipment will also be updated automatically. 
        
For Example:
   - a Protection Device will match/change when the area of the supplying equipment changes. 
   - a VFD/starter will match/change when the area of the supplying equipment changes. 
   - a local disconnect will match/change when the area of the load changes.
    
Changing the NEMA and Area Classification properties makes them different from the
the Area it is part of. It will not change these values for the entire Area. 
       
To update the properties of an Area, go to the Areas and Systems section.

    <clr:String x:Key="AreaLock" xml:space="preserve">Excludes this item from automatic Area property updates.
Ex: - Changing the area will not update the NEMA Rating, Area Class, or Temp properties.        
        
Useful if a component has specific NEMA or Area Class requirements different than the area it is in. </clr:String>

    <clr:String x:Key="LoadListOrdering" xml:space="preserve">To reorder the loads as they appear on the single line drawing,
